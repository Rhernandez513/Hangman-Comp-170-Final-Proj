After the battle you notice something appear on the altar. It's a golden key.
It must have been hidden in some compartment in the altar.

Lifting up the key you here a big rumble.
The floors come back from inside the walls and the water is quickly drained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The iron gates begin to lift up and you stumble out of the chamber, hoping
never to return.
